# Read messages from IOTA Tangle - Bachelor's thesis experiments - Federico Maffeo

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis, which is about IOTA.
Thesis work performed in collaboration with the [IDALab laboratory @ Universit√† del Salento - Italy](https://www.unisalento.it/laboratori/dipartimento-di-ingegneria-dell-innovazione/-/asset_publisher/xH087ATXxY3i/content/ida-lab/3087679)

The project consists in a script (`index.js`) that reads a message contained in the IOTA Tangle inside a zero-value transaction.

Repository content:
- the `index.js` file is the main script that performed the described action
- The `node_modules` folder contains the necessary packages and libraries to make the code work (automatically imported through the npm instruction)
- The `package.json` and the `package_lock.json` files contain information about the project and the tools needed by the npm instruction to installed needed dependencies.

### This project was inspired by the official guide on the IOTA website, that can be found in
